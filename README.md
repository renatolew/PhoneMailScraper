# PhoneMailScraper

This project aims to scrap your clipboard copied (CTRL + C) content for phone numbers and e-mail addresses and store it in the clipboard copy replacing your original data.

The regex patterns utilized in this projects follow the USA phone number pattern, but you can adjust it to your local pattern in order to adapt it to your context. 

Disclaimer: this is not an original idea. Most of this code is from Al Sweigart lesson in the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book. I strongly recommend this book if you are a beginner looking for good resources.

In order to execute this project you will need Python installed in your computer. In order to edit or complement the code you will need a text editor or IDE of your choice. I recommend Jetbrains Pycharm. You can find links to install these features below:
